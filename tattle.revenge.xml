<lb/>do beginne with the letter
<lb/>D, of which (two of them
<lb/>never were, are or will bee

<lb/>the third (which is moſt

<lb/>the abuſe of it) the onely
<lb/>bane of miſgovern'd man­
<lb/>kinde; They are <mcr>Drabbes</mcr>,
<lb/><mcr>Dice</mcr>, and <mcr>Drinke</mcr>: I will
<lb/>not ſay but Drabbes may
<lb/>prefer the Prodigall from

<lb/>where hee (being leaden
<lb/>with want, miſery, and
<lb/>diſeaſes) may bee brought
<lb/>to learne and feele the ver­

<lb/>ly, the Dicer may (by his

<lb/>the dead) be brought to

<lb/>But the <mcr>Drunkard</mcr> is im­
<lb/>placably obſtinate to bee
<lb/>ſo, he is, (as it were) rive­
<lb/>ted to <mcr>drinke</mcr>, he is inexo­
<lb/>rably rooted in his vice,
<lb/>and ſo unmoveable in his
<lb/>affection to be <mcr>drunke</mcr>, that
<lb/>though there be remedies
<lb/>for all other ſins, yet there
<lb/>is nothing but death it ſelf
<lb/>that can turn an old <mcr>Drun­
<lb/>kard</mcr> into a ſober courſe.</p>
        <p>Beſides the moſt impu­

<mw rend="align(right)" type="catch">it</mw><pb n="189"/><milestone n="I11r" unit="sig"/><mw type="pageNum">189</mw>
<lb/>it will be, they have ſome

<lb/>will warily watch that hee

<lb/>ſteales. The Whoremaſter
<lb/>will be cloſe, the Bawd will
<lb/>be ſecret, and though the
<lb/>Whore bee common, yet
<lb/>ſhee trades privately. Hee
<lb/>that takes bribes will re­

<lb/>the Projector doe ayme at

<lb/>good, though the cauſe

<lb/>told him other ways at the

<lb/>as fooles, and as beaſtly as

<lb/>this mighty and precious
<lb/>piece of ſervice was doing,
<lb/>hee plyde it hard, and in
<lb/>concluſion, hee was not
<lb/>much worſe when hee en­
<lb/>ded, then he was when hee
<lb/>began. And indeed, it is to
<lb/>be believed, that as one
<lb/>days worke cannot make
<lb/>him much the worſe, ſo it
<lb/>is to be doubted, that ma­

<lb/>neither mend or move
